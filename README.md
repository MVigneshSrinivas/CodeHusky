### Oops, run me before you raise a PR.

I check your git changes for bugs, security issues, and the kind of mistakes that make code reviewers leave passive-aggressive comments. Uses AI to read your diff and tells you what's wrong in about 10 seconds. Better than finding out after your CI pipeline fails for the third time because you forgot to update a test.

Basically prevents you from being that person who pushes broken code on Friday afternoon.
